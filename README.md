# MSc-Bioinformatics-Project-Cervical-Cancer
A project completed for the Bioinformatics module of the last semester, as part of the MSc Data Science offered by the university of Nicosia.
This project investigates the use of ML classifiers to predict four cervical cancer diagnostic outcomes: Biopsy, Schiller, Hinselmann, and Cytology.
The dataset used is composed of clinical, behavioral, and reproductive health features.

Presented here are the following project files:
1. Project Code (part 1): Code used in the initial data cleaning phase.
2. Project Code (part 2): The EDA (exploratory data analysis) and ML data preparation phase.
3. Project Code (files marked as part 3): The files for the separate Machine Learing phases for all diagnostic targets (Biopsy, Schiller, Hinselmann, and Cytology).
4. Project Report: The final report file of all the work and results (interim-paper style).

More details about the dataset and each phase are contained in the files themselves (both code and report).
